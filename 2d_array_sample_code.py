# Multidimensional list operations (comments translated)

# To declare an empty multidimensional list, you use the same syntax as declaring a one-dimensional list:
# activities = []

# Defines a two-dimensional list named activities
activities = [
    ['Work', 9],
    ['Eat', 1],
    ['Commute', 2],
    ['Play Game', 1],
    ['Sleep', 7]
]

print(activities[3][1])  # Output: 1

# To add a new element at the end of the multidimensional list, you use the append() method
activities.append(['Study', 2])

# To insert an element in the middle of the list, you use the insert() method. 
# The following inserts an element in the second position of the activities list:
activities.insert(1, ['Programming', 2])

# This example calculates the percentage of the hours spent on each activity and appends the percentage to the inner list.
for activity in activities:
    percentage = round((activity[1] / 24) * 100)
    activity.append(str(percentage) + '%')

# Pretty print the list
from pprint import pprint
pprint(activities)

# To remove an element from a list, you use the pop() or del method.
# The following statement removes the last element of the activities list
activities.pop()

# You can remove elements from the inner list of the multidimensional list by using the pop() method
# The following example removes the percentage element from the inner lists of the activities list
for activity in activities:
    activity.pop()

# To iterate a multidimensional list, you use a nested for loop

# Loop the outer list
for i in range(len(activities)):
    # Get the size of the inner list
    inner_array_length = len(activities[i])
    # Loop the inner list
    for j in range(inner_array_length):
        print(f'[{i},{j}] = {activities[i][j]}')

# Or you can use nested for loops directly
